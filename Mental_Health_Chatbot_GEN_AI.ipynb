            "Chatbot: Hello. It seems like you were in the middle of reading a passage about mental health, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you. The passage highlights the importance of individual interpretations of a good life and defines mental health as having a sense of purpose, quality relationships, self-respect, and mastery. It also acknowledges that this definition is incomplete because it doesn't take into account the impact of social and physical environments on a person's mental health.\n",

            "Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people experience depression, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's essential to recognize that depression is a complex condition that can manifest differently in different people.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering the text you provided, it's clear that you're aware of the distinction between emotional distress and depression. You've highlighted the importance of understanding that feelings of unhappiness, despondency, and hopelessness can be a normal part of the human experience, especially in response to challenging life events.\n",

            "Given your current state, I would recommend taking small, gentle steps towards self-care and seeking support. Here are a few suggestions:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Reach out to a trusted friend or family member**: Talking to someone you trust can help you feel heard, validated, and less alone.\n",
            "2. **Consider professional help**: A mental health professional can help you navigate your emotions, develop coping strategies, and provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your feelings.\n",
            "3. **Engage in self-care activities**: Try to do things that bring you comfort, relaxation, and joy, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to soothing music.\n",
            "4. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: Be gentle with yourself, and try to focus on the present moment. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can help calm your mind and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
            "5. **Take small steps towards physical activity**: Regular exercise can help improve your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. Start with short, manageable sessions, like a short walk or some light stretching.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, depression is not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you can simply \"snap out of.\" It's a complex condition that requires patience, understanding, and support.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you're in immediate distress or feeling suicidal, please know that there are resources available to help. You can call emergency services or a crisis hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the US), for confidential support.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep in mind that I'm here to listen and support you, but I'm not a substitute for professional help. If you're struggling with persistent feelings of depression, it's essential to consult with a mental health professional for personalized guidance and support.\n",
            "\n",
